# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

This repository is created to serve as a journal of my journey of learning Data Structures and Algorithms and as a resource to all those who wish to embark on this journey.

Each data structure that I will learn will be implemented using a menu driven program that allows the user to create and manipulate the data structure in any number of ways. This is done to ensure a number of important things

- Error Prevention
- Dynamic Interaction
- Consistency
- Error Handling

In short, menu driven programs ensure that the data structure is implemented in a correct fashion and the program is able to handle arbitrary user input.
